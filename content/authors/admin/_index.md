I am currently a Ph.D student at Université de Bordeaux co-supervised by Prof. Nicolas Papadakis and Dr. Arthur Leclaire. My research interests include image restoration, generative modeling, nonconvex optimization. The main objecive of my PhD is to develop inovative deep denoising priors along with convergent optimization schemes for solving image inverse problems.
